> **Note:** Photrez is a small open-source project. It started as a focused attempt to build a fast, no-nonsense desktop image editor without the bloat. If you find it useful or just want to poke around the code, welcome! Bug reports and small contributions are appreciated.

Photrez is an open-source desktop image editor with a compact, familiar workflow: layers, selection, transform, crop, brush, eraser, export, history, and a WebGL2 canvas. It is built with Tauri, SolidJS, TypeScript, and Rust (for future core compute).

Photrez is currently in **alpha** (`v0.1.0-alpha.1`). The editor is usable, but expect bugs, breaking changes, and incomplete features. Not recommended for production use.

- **Supported platform:** Windows 10/11 (macOS/Linux planned for beta)
- **Known issues:** See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- **Bug reports:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rahmanqolbi/photrez/issues)
- **Security:** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

## Why Photrez

A few things we care about:

- **Lightweight desktop feel:** a Tauri shell, compact editor chrome, and a tool-first workflow.
- **Practical editing core:** layers, transforms, crop, brush, eraser, color, export, and history.
- **Fast feedback loop:** focused unit, component, pointer-chain, browser, and Rust tests.
- **Clear boundaries:** SolidJS owns the UI, TypeScript owns the current MVP document engine, WebGL2 owns active rendering, and the Rust crates track core domain work.
- **Open-source first:** public contribution, security, governance, issue, and pull request docs are all included.

## Current Capabilities

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Custom title bar, menus, dialogs, native window actions, file open/export |
| Workspace | Multi-document tabs, drag and drop, cross-document layer movement |
| Layers | Add, duplicate, delete, reorder, opacity, visibility, lock, merge down, flatten |
| Selection | Rectangle selection, inverted selection, cut/copy/paste/delete |
| Transform | Move, scale, rotate, flip, snapping, keyboard nudges |
| Crop and resize | Classic and modern crop modes, canvas expansion, resize dialog |
| Paint | Brush and eraser with calibrated round-tip hardness, flow, smoothing, presets |
| Export | PNG, JPEG, and WebP |
| Testing | Frontend, Rust, browser, export, dialog, pointer-chain, and paint regression coverage |

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop:** Tauri 2
- **Frontend:** SolidJS, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Renderer:** WebGL2 for the current MVP runtime
- **Core:** TypeScript `DocumentEngine` for the current editor hot path
- **Rust (future):** `photrez-core` domain crate (WASM compile target)

## Runtime Architecture

Here is how the pieces talk to each other at runtime:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User([User / Pointer Input]) --> Shell[SolidJS UI]
    Shell --> Workspace[Workspace Manager]
    Workspace --> Engine[Document Engine - TS]

    Shell --> Viewport[WebGL2 Canvas]
    Engine -- Bitmaps --> Viewport

    Shell -- IPC --> Tauri[Tauri Bridge]
    Tauri --> FileIO[Rust File I/O]
    Tauri -. Reference .-> RustCore[photrez-core crate]
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Bun 1.3.14** (from [bun.com](https://bun.com)) — the repo pins it via `packageManager`, so `bun install` uses the matching version
- **Rust** stable toolchain (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- **Tauri 2 prerequisites** for your OS: <https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>
- **System WebView** (Windows: WebView2; macOS: Cocoa; Linux: webkit2gtk) — required by the Tauri shell

### Install

```bash
bun install
```

### Run the desktop app

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

### Build

```bash
bun run build
```

### Verify

```bash
bun run verify
```

Focused checks:

```bash
bun run --filter photrez-desktop test --run
bun run build
cargo test -p photrez-core
cargo test --workspace
```

## Roadmap

Near-term work is focused on:

- First-run and empty workspace polish.
- Native runtime smoke evidence.
- UI cleanup for placeholder-looking surfaces.
- Continued test coverage around real user wiring paths.
- Release notes and packaging polish.

See [Feature Status](docs/FEATURES.md) for the current implementation map.
