## ✂️ Crop + Resize

| Status       | Fitur                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop image (with bounds validation)        |
| ✅ DONE      | Resize image/canvas                        |
| ✅ DONE      | Resize canvas dialog + aspect ratio lock toggle |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop overlay/guide UI                      |
| ✅ DONE      | Interactive crop option bar (mode dropdown, editable ratio/size, guide overlay selector, delete toggle, swap W/H, reset/apply/cancel) |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop Fill BG — defaults to editor Background Color, supports crop-local custom color override, previews fill in Modern/Classic crop (with viewport panning support in both modes), and bakes fill into empty crop output areas on apply |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop box resize reactivity (overlay updates live during drag) |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop snapping — canvas edges/centers + layer edges (Smart Guides, Alt disables) |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop rotation — rotatable crop boundaries with screen-aligned visual box (canvas rotates behind), dynamic cursor, snap to 15° with Shift, angle readout, layer offset/rotation update, and local-axis resize after rotation |
| ✅ DONE      | Desktop-editor crop moving & panning — crop box remains stationary while canvas pans behind (move & resize), aligned with professional editor behavior |
| ✅ DONE      | Draw new crop box from scratch by click-dragging outside the current crop box |
| ✅ DONE      | Arrow-key crop nudge (1px, 10px with Shift) with viewport pan compensation and undo commit via `!e.repeat` guard |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop intermediate undo/redo — dedicated mini undo stack for crop rect |
| ✅ DONE      | Aspect ratio preset dropdown (12 common ratios + custom, auto-fit on select) |
| ✅ DONE      | Size mode unit conversion (px/cm/mm/in at 96 PPI) |
| ✅ DONE      | Rotate 90° buttons (↺ CCW / ↻ CW) in crop option bar |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop cancel stays in Crop tool (Esc/Cancel clears crop box without switching to Move) |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop interaction model — pasteboard click hides crop box, canvas click restores hidden crop box, drag from inside or outside canvas replaces crop box, double-click inside crop box applies crop |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop apply geometry hardening — independent X/Y target-size scaling and WebGL texture re-upload after destructive crop |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop apply viewport recentering — after crop commit, the new canvas/artboard is fitted back to the viewport center before renderer resize/upload |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop mode pasteboard panning guard — Space+drag navigation stays available while Crop tool is active |
| ✅ DONE      | Crop interaction modes — Modern (dedicated viewport-fixed centered frame; frame size tracks projected canvas bounds `docWidth × zoom × scale`, clamped by viewport; frame recomputes on zoom changes; resize clamps to projected bounds; drag/rotate transforms the image under the frame; rotation pivots around the rendered cropbox center in screen coordinates so the frame center stays visually pinned; apply uses the visual frame size and pivot rather than a rotated AABB and converts preview rotation to the crop engine convention so committed orientation matches the visual preview; drag/resize compensation stays screen-aligned under rotation; Shift/Alt/Shift+Alt resize modifiers match Classic Crop conventions where applicable; Enter applies, Esc cancels, Arrow/Shift+Arrow nudges image with undo commit, Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+Shift+Z undo/redo; resize changes frame size from center; size mode preserves target aspect ratio during resize; dedicated undo/redo stack for frame/transform operations; state resets on tool exit to prevent transform leak; canvas click creates default centered frame; canvas drag creates frame sized to selection with WYSIWYG preview; image shifts so selection content aligns with viewport-centered frame) and Classic (document-space crop box can move/resize/rotate over static image; pasteboard click creates/hides rect) toggleable via option bar |
| ✅ DONE      | Ratio Dropdown Selector — Unified presets dropdown (Free, custom, size, lock shape, recents, presets) with Swap button repositioned between W & H input fields. |
| ✅ DONE      | Smart Guides (Crop) — Snap to document edges, center, rule-of-thirds during drag-create + cyan dashed snap lines (Classic + Modern) |
| ✅ DONE      | Center-Out Drag — Alt = center-out (compensation=0, center stays fixed), Shift = square, Alt+Shift = both. Mid-drag modifier flip. Classic and Modern both verified + 9 regression tests |
| ✅ DONE      | Modern mode pasteboard drag-create — drag from outside canvas creates new crop frame in Modern mode. SVG overlay clicks routed to drag handler. Crosshair cursor on pasteboard when no frame |
| ✅ DONE      | Modern mode frame can exceed canvas bounds — `clampFrameToProjectedBounds` no longer caps at projected canvas size. Frame dimensions from viewport selection preserved (min size enforced). Enables canvas expansion workflow |
| ✅ DONE      | Modern mode drag-create clears existing frame — frame removed once drag exceeds threshold, providing clear visual feedback that a new crop is being created |
| ✅ DONE      | Canvas Expansion — Directional expansion when crop frame > canvas. Auto-trigger, expand on apply. Engine handles negative x/y crop rects (+ fill bg). Visual indicator: dashed canvas boundary + subtle expansion fill in frame overlay. Tested with fill/transparent expansion |
| ✅ DONE      | Viewport-Aware Crop Frame Position — Modern crop frame moves along with viewport during scroll, pan, shift+scroll, space+drag, and momentum. Frame position stored explicitly in `{x,y,w,h}`. Reset via fit-to-screen recenters frame. Cancel/reset restores centered position |

## 🖌️ Brush + Eraser

| Status       | Fitur                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush stroke drawing                       |
| ✅ DONE      | Eraser stroke                              |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush and eraser separate settings (size, hardness, strength) |
| ✅ DONE      | Interactive BrushOptionBar with real setting controls |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush/eraser cursor preview reflects active size and the calibrated hardness contour (single ring at 20% alpha; ~84% nominal radius at hardness 0, capped at nominal radius) |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush/eraser active-size shortcuts (`[` / `]`) |
| ✅ DONE      | Paint blocked-state feedback for locked, hidden, and protected layers |
| ✅ DONE      | Soft edge rendering via deterministic per-pixel distance-field alpha mask (within-stroke max-alpha, no accumulation, bounds-clipped) |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush-tip mask engine replacement for faster editor-like soft brush UX |
| ✅ DONE      | Hard brush (hardness=100%) solid fill (no gradient) |
| ✅ DONE      | Cursor overlay accounts for viewport pan and zoom |
| ✅ DONE      | Cursor radius follows the calibrated 20% alpha contour at any zoom level while paint Size remains nominal |
| ✅ DONE      | Pointer cancel / lost capture commits partial stroke |
| ✅ DONE      | Document-to-layer-local coordinate conversion for transformed layers |
| ✅ DONE      | Flow control — per-dab alpha multiplier (opacity × flow, 0–100%) |
| ✅ DONE      | Smoothing engine — weighted moving average (PaintSmoother, 0–100 maps to 2–10 point window) |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush presets — Hard Round, Soft Round, Detail, Large Soft, Hard Eraser, Soft Eraser |
| ✅ DONE      | Preset tracking — independent brush/eraser preset ID, manual edit clears to "Custom" |
| ✅ DONE      | Enhanced option bar — Flow input, Smoothing input, Preset dropdown |
| ✅ DONE      | Right-click context menu — Size/Hardness/Strength sliders, preset grid, Reset button, close on Escape/outside click |
| ✅ DONE      | Keyboard shortcuts — `[`/`]` for size, Shift+`[`/`]` for hardness |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush visual calibration: editor-standard hardness 0 soft-round profile with broader dense center, dense soft spacing, subpixel bilinear stamping, opacity/flow-independent alpha scale, and pixel-profile regression tests |
| ↪ SUPERSEDED | Bounded core/feather hardness models (`1 - t²`, smoothstep, and fixed cursor support) — replaced by the measured reference calibration below |
| ✅ DONE      | reference-calibrated round hardness — exact seven-point monotone-cubic sigma/n interpolation drives `exp(-((r / sigma)^n))`; hardness ≥97% keeps a literal hard-disk profile with deterministic one-pixel coverage AA at raster boundaries, also used by diameters below 22px |
| ✅ DONE      | reference editor soft-tail semantics — Size remains the nominal cursor diameter while low-hardness quantized alpha may extend beyond the cursor; finite cached bitmap support ends below half an 8-bit alpha level |
| ✅ DONE      | Alt-Hold Eyedropper modifier for sampling colors from active canvas |
| ✅ DONE      | Shift-Click Straight Lines interpolation connecting last painted dab |
| ✅ DONE      | Shift-Drag Axis Locking constraining stroke to horizontal/vertical |
| ✅ DONE      | Regression guard: Brush/Eraser still paint/erase after Move Tool pasteboard deselect hides the transform box |
| ✅ DONE      | editor-standard brush behavior — 25% × size dab spacing (visible individual dabs), hardness 100% routes through the mask engine (no `ctx.lineCap=round` shortcut), and per-dab pre-multiplied source-over accumulation so opacity/flow behave like reference editor (multiple passes darken toward saturation) |
| ✅ DONE      | Exact terminal dab landing — freehand, Shift-connected, cancel, and lost-capture completion stamp one endpoint dab at the final cursor coordinate when the 25% spacing grid did not already emit it; duplicate terminal accumulation is suppressed |
| ✅ DONE      | Live terminal dab preview — while dragging, one non-destructive region-scoped dab follows the cursor; previous transient positions never enter the permanent mask, and pointer-up promotes the endpoint exactly once |
| ↪ SUPERSEDED | Editor-style bounded smoothstep mask and exact cursor-support alignment — retained only as implementation history; runtime now follows measured reference editor bleed |
| ✅ DONE      | Brush cursor semantics — one sharp ring follows the shared 20% calibrated alpha contour below 97% hardness and the nominal Size radius at the hard edge; no duplicate support ring or filled gradient |
| ✅ DONE      | editor-standard hardness-aware brush cursor — an earlier SVG soft fill was reverted because it caused color-inversion artifacts; the retained sharp ring now changes geometry only, shared by Brush and Eraser |
| ✅ DONE      | Large hard-edge Brush/Eraser polish — cached Float32 tips reuse the existing circle-coverage function at hardness ≥97%, preserving a solid interior and nominal radius while eliminating binary single-sample stairstepping |
| ✅ DONE      | Automated Brush/Eraser visual QA — deterministic buffer-level regression coverage for large hard-edge dabs, connected long strokes, low-hardness soft-tail support, subpixel edge coverage, and Brush/Eraser mask parity |

| ✅ DONE      | E2E test: export dialog opens, format switch, quality slider |
| ✅ DONE      | E2E test: encodeComposite produces valid PNG/JPEG/WebP with correct headers/magic bytes |
| ✅ DONE      | E2E test: output dimensions match document, invisible layers excluded, transforms respected |
| ✅ DONE | Blend mode parity gate: UI exposes only the typed MVP registry (`Normal`, `Multiply`, `Screen`, `Overlay`), export compositing uses the same registry mapping, and unsupported shader-only modes are blocked until parity tests exist (`docs/reference/render-export-parity-matrix.md`). |
| ✅ DONE      | Rust unit tests: write_file_bytes creates file, read_file_bytes roundtrip, error handling (7 tests) |
| ✅ DONE      | E2E data flow test: encodeComposite → base64 → decode → byte-for-byte match + valid PNG image |
| ✅ RELEASE GATE | Native Tauri smoke checklist for app launch, OS drag/drop, cross-doc drag, native export/save, cancel export, and window controls: `docs/faang-review-rejections/2026-06-18-native-runtime-smoke-checklist.md` |

## Maintenance / Architecture Planning

| Status | Item |
| ------ | ---- |
| PLANNED | Post-MVP UI backlog preserved with entry gates and delivery order: `docs/plans/2026-06-20-post-mvp-ui-backlog.md` |
| PARTIAL | Native Tauri release smoke evidence: NATIVE-001 launch passed with retry warning; NATIVE-002 through NATIVE-007 remain pending interactive verification |
| DONE | FAANG review pointer capture helper: canvas pointer tools now use shared safe capture/release helpers with focused pointer regression tests |
| DONE | FAANG review paint command boundary: brush/eraser bitmap commits now share `commitPaintBitmap()` for history snapshot, engine mutation, texture upload, and render scheduling |
| DONE | FAANG review paint history budget gate: `perf:paint-history` now quantifies full-layer snapshot retention vs dirty-region undo/redo patch estimates for paint-heavy workflows |
| DONE | FAANG review paint transformed-layer guard: brush/eraser strokes now use explicit paint coordinate helpers backed by rotate/scale/flip mask tests |
| DONE | FAANG review tool cleanup lifecycle: active-tool switches now run through a typed `ToolId` cleanup registry instead of hardcoded cleanup inside `EditorContext` |
| DONE | FAANG review render/export blend parity gate: blend mode UI/export now share `BLEND_MODE_OPTIONS`, and shader-only modes are documented as blocked until parity proof exists |
| DONE | FAANG review WebGL context-loss lifecycle: renderer now pauses GPU work on `webglcontextlost`, rebuilds resources on `webglcontextrestored`, and triggers active-document texture re-upload |
| DONE | FAANG review WebGL context policy: renderer now initializes with `preserveDrawingBuffer: false` by default, with a regression test for the context options |
| DONE | FAANG review WebGL uniform validation: required layer shader uniforms now throw explicit missing-uniform errors instead of relying on non-null assertions |
| DONE | FAANG review architecture diagram split: `ARCHITECTURE.md` now separates active MVP runtime ownership from historical/future-target reference diagrams |
| DONE | FAANG review shell path policy: Tauri file IO now enforces import/export image extension allowlists before read/write, with Rust contract tests |
| DONE | FAANG review cross-doc Alt-move guard: moving the last layer out of a source document now aborts before target mutation, preventing copy-as-move ambiguity |
| DONE | FAANG review file-drop mutation hardening: `addFilesAsLayers` decodes the dropped-file batch before history commit/layer creation, preventing empty layer creation on file read/decode failure |
| DONE | FAANG review typed cross-doc facade hardening: `crossDocLayerOps.ts` now uses a narrow `DocumentEngine`/`WorkspaceManager`-compatible interface with no production `any` casts, backed by type-check, focused drag/drop tests, full frontend tests, and build |
| DONE | FAANG review rejection Phase 0 execution: contract drift, production context fallback, shell response panics, file IO size guard, and root static-analysis scripts addressed with green build/test/type gates |
| DONE | Production risk register hardening executed: closed drag/drop, layer reorder, export, debug-surface, and verification-script gaps with green automated gates |
| DONE | Cross-doc layer drag tab hover regression fixed: 500ms tab switch now works through real EditorProvider workspace and canvas pointer-drag tab detection |
| DONE | Ponytail refactor-from-scratch doctrine created: `docs/ponytail-refactor-doctrine/` with anti-overengineering rules, per-area playbooks, roadmap, and review checklists |
| DONE | 6-month maintainability risk register created: `docs/maintainability-risk-register/` with per-area ownership, refactor, and governance risks |
| DONE | FAANG-style review rejection register created: `docs/faang-review-rejections/` with per-area quality gate findings and remediation roadmap |
| DONE | Production bug risk register created: `docs/production-risk-register/` with release gates and per-feature/tool risk checklists |
| DONE | Viewport tool alignment browser QA hardened: Playwright smoke now covers Move Tool transform geometry across fit, zoom, and pan |
| DONE | Viewport camera regression recovery executed: one viewport adapter + reactive overlay alignment fixes |
| DONE | Viewport camera regression recovery todo created: `docs/plans/2026-06-13-viewport-camera-regression-recovery-todo.md` |
| SUPERSEDED | GPU-Accelerated smooth zoom viewport camera implementation plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-13-gpu-smooth-zoom-transitions-design.md` |
| DONE | Brush visual calibration and pixel QA plan executed: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-11-brush-visual-calibration-and-qa.md` |
| DONE | CPU brush-tip rasterizer refactored to cached single-channel Float32 alpha with calibrated padded support, pixel-center sampling, and preserved Uint8 mask/WebGL2 production wiring |
| DONE | Brush-tip mask engine implementation plan executed: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-11-brush-tip-mask-engine.md` |
| DONE | Brush hardness distance-field soft-edge implementation: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-11-brush-hardness-distance-field-soft-edge.md` |
| DONE | Brush and Eraser tool improvement plan created: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-06-brush-eraser-tool-improvements.md` |
| DONE | Crop Hidden Preview Restore correction plan created: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-crop-interaction-model-plan.md` |
| DONE | Scalability and maintainability refactor plan created: `docs/plans/2026-06-04-scalability-maintainability-refactor-plan.md` |
